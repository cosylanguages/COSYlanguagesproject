# Code Review

This document summarizes the findings of a general code review of the application.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Accessibility

*   **Missing `alt` tags:** A number of `img` tags were missing `alt` tags, or had `alt` tags that were not descriptive enough. This is an accessibility issue, as it makes it difficult for screen readers to understand the content of the images.
    *   **Solution:** I have added descriptive `alt` tags to all of the images that were missing them. I have also improved the `alt` tags of a number of other images.
*   **Language-specific `alt` tags:** The `alt` tags for the images in the `IdentifyImageExercise` and `IdentifyImageMode` components were always in English, regardless of the selected language.
    *   **Solution:** I have updated these components to use the translation of the `alt` text in the current language.

### Performance

*   **Inefficient audio playback:** The `playSound` function in `audioUtils.js` was creating a new `Audio` object every time it was called. This can be inefficient, especially if the same sound is played multiple times in a short period.
    *   **Solution:** I have updated `audioUtils.js` to use an audio pool. This will reduce the overhead of creating new objects and improve performance.

### Bugs and Minor Issues

*   **Unused `token` parameter:** The `fetchPlanData` function in `PlanContext.js` had an unused `token` parameter.
    *   **Solution:** I have removed this parameter from the function.
*   **Incorrect SRS logic in `Flashcard.js`:** The `handleReview` function in `Flashcard.js` was not calling the `onAnswered` prop if it was provided.
    *   **Solution:** I have updated the function to call the `onAnswered` prop in addition to the SRS logic.

## General Observations

Overall, the codebase is in good shape. It is well-structured and follows good practices. The issues that I found were all relatively minor and easy to fix.

I believe that the changes that I have made have improved the quality of the codebase and have made the application more accessible and performant.
