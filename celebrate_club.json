  "teacherNotes": {
    "discussionTips": "Encourage students to share traditions from their own cultures or families. The comparison matrix is a great starting point. Use the 'reinvent the holiday' section to foster creativity and more complex language use.",
    "commonPitfalls": "Students might only know about mainstream Western traditions. Gently guide them to consider a wider world of celebrations. Be prepared for some students to not celebrate New Year's in a traditional way; ensure they feel included.",
    "culturalContext": "Emphasize that what seems strange in one culture is a cherished tradition in another. The goal is to appreciate diversity, not to judge. Explain that many traditions are rooted in ancient beliefs about chasing away evil spirits and welcoming good fortune."
