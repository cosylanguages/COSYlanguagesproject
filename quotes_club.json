    "discussionTips": "Ask students to share personal stories of a 'journey' they started. It could be learning a new skill, a fitness goal, or a big project. The 'Modernize this quote' section is great for practicing informal and creative language.",
    "commonPitfalls": "Some students may find the quote too simple or obvious. Encourage them to think about why such a simple idea is so powerful and enduring. Why do people still struggle with the 'first step'?",
    "culturalContext": "The quote comes from Taoism, a philosophy that emphasizes harmony with the natural flow of things. You can briefly mention this to add depth, explaining that the quote is not just about action, but about starting in a way that is natural and not forced."
